<h3>
Introduction
</h3>

<P>The Java<sup><font size="-2">TM</font></sup> Media Framework (JMF)
is an application programming interface (API) for incorporating media
data such as audio and video into Java applications and applets. It is
specifically designed to take advantage of Java platform features.

<P>The JMF 1.0 API (the Java Media Player API) enables programmers to
develop Java programs for playback of time-based media. The JMF 2.0 API
extends the framework by providing support for capturing and storing
media data, controlling the type of processing that is performed during
playback, and performing custom processing on media data streams.  In
addition, JMF 2.0 defines a plug-in API that enables advanced
developers and technology providers to more easily customize and extend
JMF functionality.

<p>
The latest implemenation of this API from Sun is JMF 2.1.1e,
which includes several improvements to RTP/RTSP components
and numerous bug-fixes.

<p>
You can download all of the documentation for this 
release, including the setup information and sample code, from:
<blockquote>

<h3>
Quick Install</h3>

<p>
Here are some quick instructions for installing JMF 2.1.1e.
Complete instructions for setting up and running JMF are
available from the JMF web site at: 

<blockquote>
<code>
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/setup.html">
     http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/setup.html</a>
</code>
</blockquote>

<h4>
Installing JMF 2.1.1e or JMF 2.1.1e for Web Servers (i.e. Java versions)
</h4>
<p>
The install package for Java clients is a zip file. Use a zip utility
to extract the files and then set your class path to reference the JMF
directory.  For example:

<blockquote>
<p>
     On Solaris and Linux: 
<blockquote>
<code>
          setenv JMFHOME /home/someuser/JMF2.1.1 <br>
          setenv CLASSPATH $JMFHOME/lib/jmf.jar:.:${CLASSPATH}:
</blockquote>
</code>     
<p>
On AIX: 
<blockquote>
<code>
          setenv JMFHOME /usr/JMF2.1.1 <br>
          setenv CLASSPATH $JMFHOME/lib/jmf.jar:.:${CLASSPATH}:
</blockquote>
</code>
<p>
     On Windows: 
<blockquote>
<code>
          set JMFHOME=C:\JMF2.1.1 <br>
          set CLASSPATH=%JMFHOME%\lib\jmf.jar;.;%CLASSPATH%
</blockquote>
</code>
</blockquote>

<h4>
Installing JMF 2.1.1 with Solaris or Linux Performance Pack
</h4>
<p>
The Solaris and Linux install packages contain an exectuable installation
program. Run the installation program to extract JMF and then set your
class path to reference the JMF directory. For example:

<blockquote>
<code>
     setenv JMFHOME /home/someuser/JMF2.1.1 <br>
     setenv CLASSPATH $JMFHOME/lib/jmf.jar:$JMFHOME/lib/sound.jar:.:${CLASSPATH}
</code>
</blockquote>
<p>
You'll also need to set your LD_LIBRARY_PATH (shared libraries path) 
to point to the JMF libraries. For example: 
<blockquote>
<code>
     setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH $JMFHOME/lib:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH}
</code>
</blockquote>

<h4>
Installing JMF 2.1.1 with Windows Performance Pack
</h4>
<p>
The Windows install package package contains an InstallShield
installation program.  Run the installation program to extract JMF and
configure your environment variables.During installation, InstallShield
should automatically set up your CLASSPATH and PATH:

<blockquote>
<code>
     set CLASSPATH=%JMFHOME%\lib\jmf.jar;%JMFHOME%\lib\sound.jar;.;%CLASSPATH%<br>
<br>
     set PATH=%WINDIR%\System32;%PATH%    (on Windows NT) <br>
     set PATH=%WINDIR%\System;%PATH%   (on Windows 95/98) <br>
</blockquote>
</code>
<a name="verify"></a>
<h3>Verifying your Installation</h3>
<p>
To verify that JMF is set up properly on your system, use the JMF Diagnostics 
applet at:

<blockquote>
<code>
  <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/jmfdiagnostics.html">
  http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/jmf/2.1.1/jmfdiagnostics.html</a>
</code>
</blockquote>

<h3>
Security Note</h3>

<p>
During the installation, you will be asked two security related questions:
<ul>
  <li><b>Permit recording from an applet</b>
    <P>
    If you agree to this, JMF will allow applets to capture audio and
    video from the local capture devices. It is possible for a malicious
    hidden applet on a web page to quietly record sounds or video from your
    system and transmit the data back to a system on the internet. This is usually
    a risk only if you visit unfamiliar web sites.<P>
    You can disable or enable this
    feature by running the JMFRegistry application (or choose Preferences from the
    JMStudio File menu), modify the setting in the User Settings tab and commit the
    changes.<P>
  <li><b>Permit writing local files from an applet</b>
    <P>
    This is a greater security risk since a malicious applet can overwrite files
    on your hard disk without your knowledge. Enable this feature only if you
    need it for a specific application and are sure that you will not visit
    any possibly malicious web sites.<P>
    You can disable or enable this
    feature by running the JMFRegistry application (or choose Preferences from the
    JMStudio File menu), modify the setting in the User Settings tab and commit the
    changes.<P>
</ul>

<h3>
Distributing JMF with your Java software</h3>

Sun Microsystems allows vendors to distribute JMF 2.1.1e with their Java
software, as long as their software uses JMF 2.1.1e and  provided they
follow the terms of the JMF 2.1.1e Binary Code License agreement.

This document uses the term "vendors" to refer to licensees, 
developers, and independent software vendors (ISVs) who 
license and distribute the JMF with their Java programs.

<h4>
REQUIRED versus OPTIONAL FILES
</h4>

<p>
Vendors must follow the terms of the JMF Binary Code License agreement, 
which includes these terms:

<ul>
<li>Don't arbitrarily subset the JMF.  You may, however, omit those
files that have been designated below as "optional" or that are
removable by using the JMF Customizer Tool provided.

<li>Include in your product's license the provisions called out
in the JMF Binary Code License.

</ul>

<h4>
Bundling JMF
</h4>

<p>
This Solaris, Linux and Windows version of the JMF comes with its own
installer that simplifies the installation of JMF. Other versions
of JMF are bundled in a zip file which needs to be unzipped to
be installed.

<p>
Vendors have the option of delivering the Solaris, Linux, Windows, and/or zip
install binaries with their software, and having the user run them
separately, or to bundle JMF directly with the install procedures of
thier software.

<h4>
Required Files
</h4>

<p>
All the files and directories in the <b>lib</b> directory are required
unless they are listed under <b>Optional Files</b> below or are
removable using the JMF Customizer Tool. Likewise, this
<b>readme.html</b> is a required file and must always be included
with JMF 2.1.1e.

<h4>
Optional Files
</h4>

<p>
The following files are optional:

<ul>
<li>doc/*
<li>bin/*
<li>lib/soundbank.gm
<li>lib/sound.jar
<li>lib/jsound.dll or lib/libjsound.so
</ul>
